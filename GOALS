The goal of this project is not to re-create a Synergy client but I think 
that's what it'll initially turn into.  However, it seems to me that the 
Java Robot class will be too slow for mouse movements.  I find it a bit 
sluggish in Linux when dragging around windows.  It could just be the 
crappy laptop I'm running it on.

My plan was to create a fairly decent client that worked on Linux or any
other major desktop OS and then port it to Android.
